# Getting started. hi

All datasets live in the R package [IIS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IIS/index.html). For the library to run, Macs require "Xcode" and "XQuartz." 

"Xcode" can be downloaded from the AppStore. Once installed, the command "sudo xcodebuild -license" must be run from the command terminal to accept the license. 

"XQuartz" can be found on [here](xquartz.macosforge.org). XQuartz allows you to run R on the X11 server.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
